# poor man's pong

A simple Pong game for me to learn the very basics of C and SDL.

The code is ugly, I know. But I don't see a pong game in your git repo?

If (for some reason) you fancy giving this a try, clone the repository, and run:

```bash
make build;
./game;
```

To control the game, it's `D` & `F` to control the left paddle, and `J` & `K` to control the right one, because i'm not smart enough to write an opponent ai.

Alternatively, if any C / SDL veterans somehow stumbled upon this and feel like slating a guy who exclusively 'codes' in React, feel free to raise a github issue and i'll cry at what I receive. _(constructive feedback welcomed too, btw 🥲)_

> **Final Note:** I didn't intend on making pong - I had grand ambitions of making a Wolfenstein 3D - style renderer, but I got stuck at the first hurdle of, well, the coding part.
